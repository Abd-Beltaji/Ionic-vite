A boilerplate for android develeopment with ionic with a default _tabs template_ as an example.

### Used technologies:

```

## Scripts: ðŸ“œ

+ `dev`: Run the development server for the application.
+ `pre-build`: A script that will automatically run before the project build, it deletes the remains of previous builds if exists.
+ `build`: Generate a build verion of the application (a web version still).
+ `preview`: Runs vite preview script.
### `android:###`:
+ `android:pre-build`: A script that will automatically run before the project build, it deletes the remains of previous android builds if exists.
+ `android:build`: Generate an android project from the current vite build that can be opened with something like _Android Studio_ or run directly into an emulator or connected device.
+ `android:run`: Runs the current application into an emulator or a connected android device.
+ `android:open`: Opens the generated android application project into a suitable development environment (Android Studio).
### `cap:###`:
+ `cap:android`: Automates the processes of loading the application into a desired target, will build a vite version of the project then generate the android build using _capacitor_ and finally, it'll run the generated application.
